# Open-Bike-Geo

## About

Open Bike Geo is an open-sourced application that allows bicycle frame designers to investigate the influence of bicycle geometry on handling characteristics. The model is built around the popular Patterson Control Model.

To make the most out of the application, I suggest first measuring a variety of bicycles, especially those with the desired handling characteristics or geometry, to provide reference points. There is no right answer, and the optimal values will vary depending on the bicycle type, riding terrain, and personal preference. I recommend an iterative process involving this application and real world testing for the best results.
